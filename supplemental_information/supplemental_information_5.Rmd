## Description

Interval mapping (IM) and multiple-quantitative-trait-locus mapping (MQM) scans for Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease resistance traits visual rating (VR), Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK), and deoxynivalenol (DON) content quantitative trait loci (QTL) with heading date and plant height marker covariates. Environments assessed include:  Kinston, NC 2019 (KIN19) and 2020 (KIN20); Raleigh, NC 2019 (RAL19) and 2020 (RAL20); Warsaw, VA 2019 (WAR19) and 2020 (WAR20); and the multi-environment (ME). The number following MQM titles indicates which round of MQM the scan belongs to (e.g., MQM 2 is the second round of multiple QTL mapping). The y-axis displays the likelihood-of-odds (LOD) score of every position across the genome. The dotted line denotes the 1,000-permutation significance threshold at alpha = 0.05. If the significance threshold is not displayed within the graph, all peaks detected in the QTL scan were below the significance threshold. This is usually apparent in the last MQM scan performed. The x-axis displays each linkage group, designated by their corresponding chromosome names (e.g., 1A, 1B, 1D, etc.). The rug of hash marks denotes the cM position of each marker in the recombination map. All information regarding location, LOD and effect appears at the end of the document.

## QTL Scan Information

The following table displays the output results of each scan from each environment-by-trait combination. Traits assessed are heading date (HD) and plant height (PH), Fusarium head blight (FHB) visual ratings (VR), Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK), and deoxynivalenol (DON). Environments assessed are Kinston, NC 2018-2019 (KIN19) and 2019-2020 (KIN20); Raleigh, NC 2018-2019 (RAL19) and 2019-2020 (RAL20); and Warsaw, VA 2018-2019 (WAR19) and 2019-2020 (WAR20). Multi-environment scans are denoted as "ME". The column "QTL" column denotes the name of the QTL, the trait to which it belongs (e.g., Hd=HD, Pht=PH, Fvr=VR, Fdk=FDK, Don=DON) and the chromosome on which the QTL is located.
